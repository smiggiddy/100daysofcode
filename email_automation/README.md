# Project: Automate something in life

Day 97. 

I recently needed to contact a Govt agency a few times via email. I wasn't getting a response to my emails. So I created a script to email them once a week using python and cron in linux. 


1. Approach
    - This exercise should only take 150 minutes
    - Revise script to configure MIME Types

2. Hard part:
    - this project was straight forward. 
    - hardest part was remembering the methods needed
    - thinking of something to automate. 
        - I've already automated a lot of my life, so finding something else to automate was a challenge

3. Easy part:
    - everything. 

4. Biggest Learning:
    - you can use more than one tool to accomplish a job.
